# Vehicle-Insurance-claim-Fraud-Detection
## Description:
Fraud that involves cell phones, insurance claims, tax return claims, credit card transactions, government procurement etc. represent significant problems for governments and businesses and specialized analysis techniques for discovering fraud using them are required.

Insurence fraud detection is a challenging problem, given the variety of fraud patterns and relatively small ratio of known fraoud in samples. while building a detection models, the savings from loss prevention need to be balanced with cost of false alerts.

## Objective:

This Project was develeop to detect the fraude in Insurace Company that provide the Insurace for vehicle which damage in Acident or Stolen by Thief. This Project Detect Insurance Claim by person is legitimate or not.

## How Fraude Detection System Work:

## Type of Fraude Detection Techniques:

Fraud detection generally involves data analysis-based techniques. These techniques are broadly categorized as statistical data analysis techniques and artificial intelligence or AI-based techniques.

In this project i have use the Machine Learning techniques. Because Machine Learning Algorithm has ability to earn from historical fraud patterns and recognize them in future transactions. Machine learning either uses supervised or unsupervised learning methods.  In supervised learning, a random subsample of all records is manually classified as either ‘fraudulent’ or ‘non-fraudulent’. In unsupervised learning, on the other hand, methods search for common patterns (i.e., fraudulent) and correlations in the raw data, and predictions are built without additional labeling.
